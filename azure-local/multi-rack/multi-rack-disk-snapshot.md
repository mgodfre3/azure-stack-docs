# Create and restore data disk snapshots on Azure Local

Disk snapshots let you capture a point-in-time copy of a data disk so that you can recover data or quickly provision new disks from a known-good state. This article walks you through creating a snapshot from an existing data disk and restoring a new disk from that snapshot on Azure Local.

> [!NOTE]
> This article covers data disk snapshots only. OS disk snapshot and restore isn't included in this release.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

- A custom location for your Azure Local instance. The custom location also appears on the **Overview** page for Azure Local.
- A data disk to use as the source for creating a snapshot.

## Supported and unsupported data disk snapshot scenarios

- Only crash-consistent disk snapshots are supported.
- Live VM state (memory/CPU) and app-consistent snapshots aren't supported.
- Full VM snapshot with all disks in a single operation isn't supported. Snapshots are disk-level, not VM-level.

## Install or verify the Azure CLI extension

The `az stack-hci-vm` commands are provided by the `stack-hci-vm` Azure CLI extension.

1. Verify your Azure CLI version (the extension metadata requires Azure CLI core version 2.15.0 or later):

   ```azurecli
   az version
   ```

1. Install the extension (or update it if it's already installed):

   ```azurecli
   az extension add --name stack-hci-vm
   ```

1. Verify the extension is installed:

   ```azurecli
   az extension show --name stack-hci-vm
   ```

## Sign in and set subscription

Before you run any commands, sign in to Azure and select the subscription that contains your Azure Local resources.

1. Sign in:

   ```azurecli
   az login --use-device-code
   ```

1. Set your subscription:

   ```azurecli
   az account set --subscription <Subscription ID>
   ```

## Create a snapshot from a data disk

Use `az stack-hci-vm snapshot create` to create a snapshot from a source disk.

```azurecli
az stack-hci-vm snapshot create --resource-group <resource-group> --custom-location <custom-location-arm-id> --location <location> --name <snapshot-name> --source-resource-id </subscriptions/{sub}/resourceGroups/{rg}/providers/Microsoft.AzureStackHCI/virtualHardDisks/{diskName}>
```

## List existing snapshots

To view snapshots in a specific resource group, run the following command:

```azurecli
az stack-hci-vm snapshot list --resource-group <resource-group>
```

To list snapshots in the subscription:

```azurecli
az stack-hci-vm snapshot list
```

## View snapshot details

To view the properties of a specific snapshot, run the following command:

```azurecli
az stack-hci-vm snapshot show --resource-group <resource-group> --name <snapshot-name>
```

## Update snapshot tags

After a snapshot is created, only its tags can be updated. Use tags to organize and categorize your snapshots.

```azurecli
az stack-hci-vm snapshot update --resource-group <resource-group> --name <snapshot-name> --tags <key>=<value> <key>=<value>
```

## Restore a new data disk from a snapshot

To restore a disk from a snapshot, create a new disk by specifying the snapshot ARM ID in `--source-resource-id`.

```azurecli
az stack-hci-vm disk create --resource-group <resource-group> --custom-location <custom-location-arm-id> --location <location> --name <new-disk-name> --source-resource-id </subscriptions/{sub}/resourceGroups/{rg}/providers/Microsoft.AzureStackHCI/snapshots/{snapshotName}>
```

## Validate the restored disk

After the disk restore completes, verify that the new disk was created successfully and is available in your resource group.

```azurecli
az stack-hci-vm disk show --resource-group <resource-group> --name <new-disk-name>
```

You can also list disks in the resource group:

```azurecli
az stack-hci-vm disk list --resource-group <resource-group>
```

## Clean up resources

If you no longer need a snapshot, you can delete it to free up resources. Deleting a snapshot doesn't affect any disks that were already restored from it.

```azurecli
az stack-hci-vm snapshot delete --resource-group <resource-group> --name <snapshot-name>
```
